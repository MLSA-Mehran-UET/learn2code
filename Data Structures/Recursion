A Recursive task is a task that is defined in the terms of itself. Recursive function calls itself. 
With each invocation, the problem is reduced to a smaller task (reducing case) until the task arrives at some terminal case. A recursive function has two parts:
1.	Terminal/base case. a stopping conditions.
2.	Reducing case/recursive step an expression of the computation or definition in terms of itself.
Syntax:
if (terminal_condition)
     terminal_case
else
     reducing_case
