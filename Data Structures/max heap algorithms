Max heap constuction algorithm
It is about how to derive an algorithm for max heap by inserting one element at a time. 
At any point of time, heap must maintain its property. While insertion, we assume that we are inserting a node in an already heapified tree.
Step 1 − Create a new node at the end of heap.
Step 2 − Assign new value to the node.
Step 3 − Compare the value of this child node with its parent.
Step 4 − If value of parent is less than child, then swap them.
Step 5 − Repeat step 3 & 4 until Heap property holds.


Max heap delete algorithm
Step 1 − Remove root node.
Step 2 − Move the last element of last level to root.
Step 3 − Compare the value of this child node with its parent.
Step 4 − If value of parent is less than child, then swap them.
Step 5 − Repeat step 3 & 4 until Heap property holds.
