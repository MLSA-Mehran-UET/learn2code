# Data Structures

**Data Structures** is a named location that can be used to store and organize data. And, an algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem. Learning data structures and algorithms allow us to write efficient and optimized computer programs.

There are a variety of data structures, including, stack, queue, linked list, hash table, heap data structures, tree based data structures, and much more.

All you have to do is, to add a data structure in their respective folder (create new folder, if not already) in your own preferred language, that too, in the respective folder on a language inside the data structure folder that you desire.

    e.g. learn2code/Data Structure/Sorting/C++/selectionSort.cpp
